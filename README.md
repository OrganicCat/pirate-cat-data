pirate-cat-data
===============

<p>Serves up an excellent platter of cat data, my resume.</p>

<p>I haven't used Github much as you can see by my repositories (mostly tortoise SVN), but now that they have the nifty Windows tool, I found it extremely easy to hook 
  up my code without a problem.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is almost completely new to me, I barely gave it a shot before, but got discouraged early on due to grabbing too large of an IDE and getting lost in it. 
  This time around has been much better, I grabbed the "Textmate for windows" <a href="http://redcareditor.com/">Redcar</a>, which has worked pretty amazingly despite being 
  in alpha. I admit to doing one scaffold of a class I didn't get to implement, called "Users". I mainly did it to see how the syntax worked though since I've never programmed 
  in RoR before. I generated controllers (no auto scaffold methods though) past that. Everything else, mistakes and all, is mine.</p>
  
<p>The total time I have gotten to spend actually programming, and I'm including looking things up, installing things, learning the language, is about 5 hours total 
  over a day and a half. I really have no idea if that's spectacular or horrible. I do know I had a whole mess of fun learning it this time around and will likely 
  replace my daily PHP coding with Ruby immediately. If you didn't know (or care) my blog is being written from scratch in PHP which makes development easy and fast 
  but also horribly messy since it's the farthest thing from OOP unless you use CodeIgniter or Kohana. Speaking of which, my experience in those PHP frameworks has 
  helped the adoption of Ruby since they seem to be based off it, all the way down to the directory structure setup.</p>
  
<p>As a last bit of gushing before I get to the install, I've followed your website for a while and always loved the design (for the year and half I've known about you). 
  I would love nothing more than to be part of your team, and contribute some totally pirate-tastic (but not spaghetti) code to your pirate crew! Or zombie crew. I'm 
  never sure which side to take. Everyone knows ninjas are old hat.</p>
